# Deep Computer Vision
Diabetes remains one of the increasing concerns for all of humanity, and along with it comes 
other problems like Diabetic Retinopathy. A patient with diabetes has about a 30% likelihood 
of developing Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), according to several surveys. There are many 
stages of DR, from mild to severe, and PDR (Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy). If the 
disease is not identified in the early stages, it might eventually result in blindness and cause 
floaters and blurred vision in its later stages. The manual diagnosis of these image datasets 
takes a lot of time and expertise, and it is challenging. This project has suggested computer 
vision-based methods for automatically detecting DR and its various stages. For the purpose 
of identifying and classifying the various stages of the DR in color fundus pictures, we put 
forth a CNN ensemble-based framework. In this project, we have also proposed various 
approaches to address the image imbalance problem that comes with the Diabetic Retinopathy 
Datasets in order to encourage research in medical image segmentation, classification, and 
preprocessing techniques, particularly for the community of diabetic retinopathy diagnosis.
